This is my Galvanize Capstone Project that was done in 2 weeks as a culmination of everything I had learned in the past 6 months.

This repository is deployed to Heroku.

To see the live application, it is deployed to an AWS S3 Bucket at the link below.

# The Process

* Created end-points of the API to give access to the Front-End to all of the data needed for each route.
* Set up the Twitter Stream and Sentiment Analysis for incoming tweets to @PowerRankingApp and associating a score to a given subject.
* Tested routes to make sure it was sending the correct data.
